  <h1> Welcome to Manchester!</h1>
  <p class="big">Manchester is located in the northwestern part of England, which makes up part of the United Kingdom. Manchester is one of the most visited cities in the country. Soccer, or Football as it is known in England, is very popular in this city. The two most
    popular and successful teams are Manchester City, and Manchester United.</p>

  <h2>Manchester is not all about football</h2>
  <p class="big"> Known as the "Rainy City," you can guess what the weather is like most of the time in Manchester. Manchester is also known for being the first city to introduce the first Inter-city passenger railway system, linking the city with Liverpool. It is also
    a city known for its scientific endeavors, with Ernest Rutherford first splitting an atom at the University of Manchester. Aside from the local football clubs, the city has also hosted many sporting events like the Cycling World Championship.
